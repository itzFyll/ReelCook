# ðŸ“š ReelCook: The Recipe Hub to go from Reel To Book in a Flash

## Project Description

Welcome to **ReelCook**, an innovative web application (with future mobile considerations) designed to revolutionize how you create, organize, and personalize your culinary recipes. This project aims to provide users with an unparalleled level of customization for their digital cookbooks, coupled with cutting-edge AI-driven capabilities for effortless recipe generation from virtually any source. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a home cook, MyCustomCookbook is built to adapt to your unique style and needs.

The core idea is to empower users to:
* **Customize Cookbook Layout & UI:** Tailor the look and feel of their cookbook with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, leveraging both custom and default templates for a truly personal touch.
* **Effortlessly Edit Recipes:** Full control over recipe content, allowing for easy modifications and refinements.
* **Generate Recipes Automatically from Diverse Sources:**
    * **From Scratch:** Users can manually input their own recipes.
    * **From Images:** Utilize advanced AI (image-to-text) to extract recipes from photos of text or even identify ingredients from pictures (image recognition).
    * **From Web Articles/Blogs:** Data scraping capabilities to import recipes directly from URLs.
    * **From Videos:** An advanced and custom LLM AI system will scrape recipe information from platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Reels, combining voice-to-text, comment data scraping, and image-to-text analysis.

This project's primary focus is on delivering:
* **User-Friendly UI Customization:** Non-technical users can easily design their cookbook's interface through drag-and-drop components and a rich selection of templates.
* **Intelligent AI Recipe Generation:** Leveraging artificial intelligence to automatically generate recipes from web articles, images, and video content, making recipe collection smarter and faster.

## Project Motives

This project is a personal sandbox and a cornerstone for my software development portfolio. While it may not ultimately go to market, its primary purpose is to explore, experiment with, and master new technologies. I'm particularly keen on diving deep into cloud computing services and leveraging various artificial intelligence models (such as image-to-text, voice-to-text, and custom LLMs for data scraping). This is an opportunity to build something complex and challenging, have fun with cutting-edge tech, and showcase a diverse skill set in a practical application.
