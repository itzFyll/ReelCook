# Project Description + Project Specific Instructions

## Project Context and preferences that AI should follow
A web application (with future mobile support) designed to let users create and 
fully customize their own digital cookbooks. The platform emphasizes an easy-to-use, 
drag-and-drop UI for non-technical users and leverages AI to automatically 
generate recipes from various sources, including images, web articles, and videos.

* Focus on highly customizable cookbook UI (drag & drop, templates,
 easy editing for non-technical users)
* AI-powered recipe generation from multiple sources: manual entry, images (image-to-text),
 web/blog URLs (data scraping), and videos (voice-to-text, image recognition, comment scraping)
* Iterative development: start with basic manual recipe creation and UI,
 then add AI import/generation features and advanced customization
* Cloud-first infrastructure with future plans for AWS hosting and scalability
* Project serves as a portfolio and experimentation ground for new tech, cloud,
 and AIâ€”market release is not the primary goal
